        <h3>Where Myth Meets Reality</h3>
        <p>
          Legend has it that Ha Long Bay's limestone formations were created
          when dragons spat out jewels and jade into the bay to create a natural
          fortress against invaders. The jewels turned into islands and islets,
          forming the magnificent landscape we see today.
